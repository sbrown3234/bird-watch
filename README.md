<h1>About Bird Watch</h1>
<p>Bird Watch was made with my grandparents in mind. They love to bird-watch, and I remember them telling me all the time about different types of birds and which ones could be found in their backyard. Bird Watch was made for them, with a clear and easy-to-read UI that would make the experience of looking at your favorite birds from all over the world an easy and stress-free activity.</p>
